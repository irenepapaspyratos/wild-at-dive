# Wild at Dive

This is the final [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)  project (bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)) of my Web Development Certification in 2022 at Neue Fische.

Thanks to Cesium, it contains an interactive 360Â° rotating globe to find, add or edit diving spots all over the world. The intention was, to keep a nice place to save all the spots, where diving-trips are organized with special, rare and/or dangerous animals. Visitors simply can click on each spot to see all it's details displayed. 

At the moment this project is under construction, so only the preview is available - showing the diving spots on an invisible globe. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
